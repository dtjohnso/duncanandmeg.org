# Code for duncanandmeg.org

I used a Jekyll theme based on [landing-page bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/templates/landing-page/) to build duncanandmeg.org.

Since I don't host <duncanandmeg.org> here, I just build the site locally with `jekyll build` and then ftp the contents of the generated _site folder up to the host when something changes (basically never).
